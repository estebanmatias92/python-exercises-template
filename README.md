# Python Docker Dev Environment

An isolated Docker Development Environment for building Python Apps.

## Use

### 1 - Create Docker Dev Environment

Use this github url to create the Docker Dev Environment in Docker Desktop.

### 2 - Open with VS Code

Once created the Environment, open it with VS Code

*`python -m venv venv && . venv/bin/activate`*

Proceed to install the first dependencies

#### (The way to go)

You can save time and effort and use Make to create the project and install the dependencies, and activate the environment immediately afterwards

*`make build && . venv/bin/activate`*

To run the app, use Make Run
