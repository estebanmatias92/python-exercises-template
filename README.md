# Python Docker Dev Environment

An isolated Docker Development Environment for building Python Apps.

## Use

### 1 - Create Docker Dev Environment

Use this github url to create the Docker Dev Environment in Docker Desktop.

### 2 - Open with VS Code

Once created the Environment, open it with VS Code

### 3 - Create a new Python project

Now from the terminal you can run the Python CLI commands and create with a new environment

*`python -m venv venv && . venv/bin/activate`*

Proceed to install the first dependencies

*`pip install -r requirements.txt`*

#### (Running all together with Make)

You can save time and effort and use Make to create the project and install the dependencies, and activate the environment immediately afterwards

*`make && . venv/bin/activate`*

To run the app, use Make Run

*`make run`*

Auto-install imported packages and upgrade all packages

*`make update`*

To manually update the requirements.txt file with the latest packages use Make Freeze

*`make freeze`*

If you need to remove cache files or the environment use Make Clean

*`make clean`*

Uninstall all the environment packages

*`make uninstall`*
